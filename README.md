#Implementation of a fully connected neural network
## Libraries used
The only library used for matrix operations is NumPy.

## Backward propagation and Gradient Descent algorithm
The formulas used in this implementation are the ones given on this <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html">link</a>. Their demonstration is done by applying the chain rule.
